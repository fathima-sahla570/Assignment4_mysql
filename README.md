This assignment focuses on practicing Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform various operations on relational database tables. 
The goal is to improve understanding and skills in creating tables, inserting data, and querying data for analysis. 
You will use two tables—Country and Persons—to perform operations such as string manipulation, aggregation, filtering, sorting, and inserting data
Tasks
1. Create Tables
Use the schema above to define the Country and Persons tables.
2. Insert Data
Insert 10 rows into both tables with realistic values to set up the database for testing the queries.
3. Queries
Print the first three characters of Country_name from the Country table.
Concatenate Fname and Lname into a full name from the Persons table.
Count the number of unique country names in the Persons table.
Find the maximum population from the Country table.
Find the minimum population from the Persons table.
Insert 2 new rows to the Persons table with Lname as NULL. Then count all Lname values in the Persons table.
Count the total rows in the Persons table.
Display the population of the first three rows of the Country table (use LIMIT).
Print three random rows from the Country table (use RAND() and LIMIT).
List all persons ordered by their rating in descending order.
Find the total population for each country in the Persons table.
List countries in the Persons table with a total population greater than 50,000.
For countries with more than two persons, list the total number of persons and average rating for each country, ordered by average rating in ascending order.
